# mobile-wallet-simulate

Now create a mobile wallet app that will simulate this in a way that if i wanted to top up then i will select a button topup then to avoid big form, since this is a wallet app so lets say we implemented a logic of putting the name, address etc during the onboarding or kyc so basically the input that will be just needed is the amount in peso, as also you can notice that on that curl the amount is 100.00 but in reality the amount of it is just 1 php so implement a logic that convert the 100.00 into 1.00 on the ui so the user will input what a the real amount he needs to top up
